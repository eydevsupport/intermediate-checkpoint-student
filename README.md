# Big Tomato Case Study

In late 2017, tomato farmer, Toma Toe, purchased struggling tomato sauce manufacturer, Big Tomato Sauce Co. (BTSC). He knew that BTSC relied too heavily on antiquated methods and technologies to produce their sauce. One of the first investments Toma plans to make is launching a new web application to monitor and track the farms tomato usage. Toma has already begun to brag to other farmers that this new web platform will help him achieve the greatest “farm to sauce” efficiency in town. Toma is confident that this one investment will be the catalyst in increasing the company’s incredibly low profit margin.

After sitting through countless demos from various tech companies, farmer Toma decided to engage Ernst & Young LLP (EY). The two parties have discussed and agreed upon the minimal viable product specifications. EY has already started development but requires your help to get them across the finish line. See instructions below for setting up your local dev environment and the tasks assigned to you. 
 
## Pre-requisites:
  - Register for a github account (if you do not already have one)
  - Install Dependencies 
  - [Git tools](http://msysgit.github.io/)
  - [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Setting Up Local Repository

  - Login to Github. Click the New Repository button. Name your repository "surname-ey-intermediate-checkpoint". 
  - Set your repository to Public and do not initialize with a readme. 
  - Click Create Repository.
  - Copy the repository URL. 
  - Using the command line, navigate to a directory on your machine where you would like to save your repository.  
  - Run `git clone REPOSITORY_URL`. Then in your command line, change directories into the newly created empty repository folder. 
  - Using windows explorer, unzip the attachment that has been provided to you and save the contents into the directory. 
  - Now that you have copied the contents it's time to push them up to your remote repository. In your command line, run `git add .` then hit enter. Then run `git commit -m "initial commit"`. Then run `git push`. Now your github repo is ready to go and it's time to install the required dependencies. 
  - Run the command ```npm install```
    - If running this command alters the .package.json file and the .json file, use the ```git checkout``` command to discard those changes. Running ```git status``` will give you instructions on how to use ```git checkout```.
  - When you are ready to run the site locally, run the commands:
	  - ```npm run dev``` 
	  - ```npm run api```

Note: You will need to run these commands in separate command line windows. The command ```npm run dev``` runs a local server on your machine that hosts the site. The command ```npm run api``` runs a mock api that hosts all of the data for the assessment.  

You are now ready to start working on the site. The site is set up with LiveReload. This means that when you save your code in your text editor, the page will automatically reload for you. We have noticed that there are a few instances where the LiveReload can lag, so if you are not seeing your changes immediately, give it a few seconds to catch up. 

## Requirements: 

### General

  - Use git branching (i.e., do not push code to master).
  - Write all angular code (Angular 1) consistent with the [John Papa Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).
  - DO NOT USE ES6 or later. 
  - Stick to the requirements, however, if you feel that there are other opportunities to improve the code or create new features feel free to do so. 
  - Remember, styling is important! This is going directly to a client. Feel free to add all custom styles to the main.css file.
  - Your application should be mobile friendly. 
  - The application requires you to use Toma's Tomato Farm API. The API allows you to retrieve Tomato and Farm information. 
    - The API has the following endpoints:
      - `http://localhost:3000/tomatoes` - Get All Tomatoes
      - `http://localhost:3000/farms` - Get All Farms

### Navigation

Top Navigation: A basic bootstrap top navigation menu directive has been started for you. Use the bootstrap [nav-bar docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar) to implement the following features:
  - Add ```tomato-logo.png``` image to the left side of the navigation menu. See screenshot below:
  
   ![nav-logo](https://github.com/eydevsupport/intermediate-checkpoint/blob/master/app/assets/images/readme-images/top_nav_logo.png)

### Data Visualization

  - The EY Developer team has already started putting together the required data visualizations. The page contains one data visualization using [Angular-Chart.js](http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/) to display 'Total Ounces of Tomatoes Produced By Color By Season' in Bar-Chart form. We need your help to create an Angular-Chart.js Line-Chart displaying Total Tomato Revenue by Season. 

  Notes: 

    - Make sure to use the tomato-card.directive as a container for your graph.
    - All calculations required for the charts have been provided in the tomato-chart.service. Utilize this as you create the Revenue chart. 

### Grid Display

  - Toma would also like to see an inline grid display of all the tomatoes by farm. See user stories below for specific requirements:

  User Stories:

    - A user should only see tomatoes for one farm at a time.
    - A user should be able to select different farms from a tabbed menu at the top of the grid.
    - A user should see the following columns: 'Color', 'Cost, 'Ounces', 'Picked?' and 'Season'.
    - A user should see a maximum of 15 tomatoes in the grid at once with the option to paginate.
    - A user should be able to search through the data using a text input field.

  Note: Utilize the [Pagination Directive](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination) that is already included in the repository.
